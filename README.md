### - HoyoHelper

The Hoyo Helper project is designed to help players of Hoyoverse games automate the claiming of web-based daily login rewards 
without needing to manually access the website. It offers two solutions: a standalone file for batch automation of multiple accounts and a 
QT-based app with an intuitive interface for managing accounts and automating logins.
<details>
<summary>üìñ More about this project</summary>

The Hoyo Helper project simplifies the process of claiming daily login rewards for Hoyoverse games by automating logins
to Genshin Impact (GI), Honkai: Star Rail (HSR), and Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ). The standalone version supports bulk
automation for multiple accounts, while the QT-based app provides a user-friendly GUI for storing accounts and configuring
automated logins. Using Playwright, the project ensures efficient and asynchronous handling of login processes and session
management. The backend scripting handles credentials securely, working seamlessly with the automation. Modular development
allows each component‚ÄîPlaywright scripts, backend login functionality, and the GUI‚Äîto evolve independently while laying the
groundwork for future integration. This approach ensures a cohesive user experience in the final product. Currently under
active development, the project will eventually deliver expanded automation capabilities and an enhanced GUI. Contributions
are welcome to help refine the code, report bugs, or suggest new features under the GNU Affero General Public License.

### - RagStack

This project is a comprehensive RAG pipeline implementation that includes YouTube and web scraping tools for data collection,
Milvus as a vector database for efficient context retrieval, and a Tkinter-based multi-user chatbot interface. It also features
data visualization tools enhanced with PyCUDA for analyzing large datasets.

<summary>üìñ More about this project</summary>

This project demonstrates a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, incorporating YouTube and web scraping tools
to extract, process, and summarize content. The YouTube scraper downloads video transcripts and metadata, while the web scraper
gathers text and links from specified domains, with both systems designed for scalable task management. Processed data is embedded
using a custom API and stored in Milvus, a high-performance vector database, for efficient retrieval. The chatbot app utilizes
Milvus to fetch relevant context and a generation API to construct conversational responses, presented in a Tkinter-based GUI with
multi-user and multi-conversation support. The Milvus data loader ensures seamless embedding and storage of textual data with
advanced indexing for optimized performance. Data visualization tools, accelerated by PyCUDA, enable efficient analysis of the
retrieved content. Configuration is handled via environment variables and modular setups, allowing flexibility in scaling and
customization. This project provides a foundational understanding of RAG pipelines and the associated technology stack for building
sophisticated retrieval and generation systems.
